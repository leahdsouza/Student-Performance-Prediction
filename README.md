# Student-Performance-Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict student performance based on factors like hours studied, previous scores, extracurricular activities, sleep hours, and sample question papers practiced.

## Project Overview
The project involves the following steps:

- Data Summarization: Summarize the dataset to understand its size, the types of features (continuous or categorical), and any notable characteristics.
- Statistical Analysis and Visualization: Display statistical values for each attribute and visualize their distributions. Identify and explain any attributes that might require special treatment.
- Relationship Analysis: Analyze relationships between features and between features and the target variable using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and scatter plots.
- Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring the test set is representative of the entire dataset.
- Model Training: Train a Linear Regression model using both a closed-form solution and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
Apply Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net regularization, experimenting with hyperparameters to improve performance.
Train Polynomial Regression models and evaluate their performance.
- Model Evaluation: Make predictions on the test set and summarize performance using appropriate evaluation metrics. Discuss potential improvements and further exploration.

## Dataset Used
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle [Student Performance - Multiple Linear Regression on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression)
